//The local movie theater in town has a ticket price of $12.00 but if you are a senior (55 and older), under 10 you get the discounted price of $7.00. 
//In addition, if a customer is seeing a movie between 3pm and 5pm they can also get the discounted price.
//Determine which of the two prices the customer is eligible for.
