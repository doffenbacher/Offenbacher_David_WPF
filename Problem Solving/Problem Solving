A Cat, a Parrot, and a Bag of Seed:
There is a man, a cat, a parrot, and a bag of seed on one side of a river. He has to transport all three items to the otherside on his boat, but only himself and one other item will fit on the boat. If the man leaves the cat alone with the parrot the cat will eat the parrot. If the man leaves the parrot alone with the seed the parrot will eat the seed. How can the man get all three items across without leaving the wrong items alone together?
